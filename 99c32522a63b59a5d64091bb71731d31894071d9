      "message": "Lets do this if the other thing sticks and directly after a branch cut.\n\nMost efficient way to review this is probably to do a git cl patch, grab upstream from github and copy all files over. This will create a lot of untracked files but no diffs (I did this myself in the last PS and whoops, I forgot a few!)",

      "message": "Thanks.\n\nSince we are here, WDYT about switching to a mode where we have //third_party/libsrtp/BUILD.gn checked into Chromium\u0027s //third_party and then we add an entry into DEPS to fetch src/third_party/libsrtp/src.\n\nSo we remove the need to do the manual stuff, and we just have to change the commit pointed by DEPS and fix the BUILD.gn in the same CL.\n\nI know it is a bit more work, but the current state of libsrtp is not great and this is part of the reason it doesn\u0027t get rolled often.",
