      "message": "BUILD.gn looks good; I did have one unresolved comment on crypto/Makefile.in though.\n\nAs for whether we need to manually review all the libsrtp commits, I\u0027m not sure. We haven\u0027t done that with usrsctp in the past, it just wouldn\u0027t be sustainable. I do see libsrtp has a fuzzer (which was added to OSS-fuzz last year), so that provides some insulation against security bugs. Maybe wait to see what Bjorn thinks.",
